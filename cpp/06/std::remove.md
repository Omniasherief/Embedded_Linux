# Using `std::remove` in C++

`std::remove` is a commonly used algorithm in C++ for removing elements from a container, but it can be tricky because it doesn't physically remove elements from the container. Instead, it rearranges the elements so that the elements to be "removed" are moved to the end of the container, and returns an iterator pointing to the new end of the "valid" range.

## Common Issues with `std::remove`

### 1. Not Using the Returned Iterator
- `std::remove` does not actually change the size of the container. Instead, it moves the elements to be "removed" to the end of the container, and returns an iterator to the "new end" of the valid elements.
- If you don't use this iterator to erase the elements, the unwanted elements will remain in the container in an undefined state.

  ```cpp
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 6};
  std::remove(v.begin(), v.end(), 3); // This does not change the size of the vector
  ```

### 2. Not Erasing the Elements After `std::remove`
- To actually remove the elements from the container, you need to use the `erase` function in conjunction with `std::remove`.

  ```cpp
  v.erase(std::remove(v.begin(), v.end(), 3), v.end()); // This removes all elements equal to 3
  ```

- In this example, `std::remove` shifts the elements that are not `3` to the front, and `erase` removes the unwanted elements, effectively resizing the vector.

### 3. Using `std::remove` with Containers That Don't Support Erasing
- `std::remove` works with sequence containers like `std::vector`, `std::deque`, and `std::list`. However, it doesn't work directly with associative containers like `std::set` or `std::map`, which require different approaches for element removal.

## Example of Correct Usage

Here's an example that demonstrates the correct use of `std::remove`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // For std::remove

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 6};

    // Use std::remove to move all elements that are not 3 to the front
    auto newEnd = std::remove(v.begin(), v.end(), 3);

    // Erase the elements beyond the new end
    v.erase(newEnd, v.end());

    // Now the vector only contains elements that are not 3
    for (int i : v) {
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Expected Output

```
1 2 4 5 6
```

In this example:
- `std::remove` shifts the elements that are not `3` to the front of the vector.
- `v.erase(newEnd, v.end())` removes the extraneous elements from the vector, effectively resizing it.

## Summary

- **`std::remove`** does not change the size of the container; it only shifts the elements.
- Always follow `std::remove` with a call to `erase` if you want to actually remove elements from the container.
- Remember that `std::remove` can be used with sequence containers but not directly with associative containers like `std::set` or `std::map`.
