**Notes on Distance Limitations:**

- **UART:** RS232 is suitable for short-distance communication (~15 meters), while RS485 supports longer distances (up to 1200 meters) due to differential signaling.

- **I2C:** Designed for short-distance, intra-board communication. Standard bus capacitance limits effective distance to around 1 meter. However, with lower clock speeds and proper cabling (e.g., twisted pair wires), distances up to 10 meters or more can be achieved. citeturn0search2

- **SPI:** Typically used for short distances (up to 1 meter). Longer distances are possible by reducing clock speeds and using appropriate cabling, but signal integrity becomes a concern.

- **CAN:** Effective up to 40 meters at 1 Mbps. For longer distances, reducing the data rate allows communication over several hundred meters.

- **Ethernet:** Standard Ethernet cables (Cat5e/Cat6) support distances up to 100 meters. For longer distances, fiber optic cables are used.

- **USB:** USB 2.0 supports up to 5 meters; USB 3.0/3.1 up to 3 meters. Using hubs or active repeaters can extend these distances.

- **WiFi and Bluetooth:** Wireless communication ranges vary based on environmental factors and device power. Obstacles, interference, and antenna design significantly impact effective range.

When designing systems, it's crucial to consider these distance limitations alongside factors like data rate requirements, environmental conditions, and cabling quality to ensure reliable communication.
